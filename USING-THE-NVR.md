## Using the NVR

### The Menus

The NVR has a menu bar at the top of the page. On a PC screen
this menu bar will normally show the menu names, though on a mobile
device a <img src="README.images/hamburger-2-svgrepo-com.svg" width="20"  style="position: relative; top: 5px"></img> icon must be tapped to reveal them.

Before any option is selected, the
page below the menu bar will be blank.

#### Select Camera
This menu allows selection of live video/audio camera streams. The names
are listed in the form <i>Camera Name(Stream Description)</i>
so there can be more than one stream per camera.

> On selecting the live stream, the video will be shown with a
<img src="README.images/stopwatch-svgrepo-com.svg" width="20"  style="position: relative; top: 5px"></img>
icon just below it.
> 
> If audio is enabled for the stream, a speaker icon will be shown which, by
> clicking on it will show volume control, a mute button and latency chasing enable/disable checkbox to set the audio as required.
>

>* Click on the speaker button to mute/unmute the audio.
>* Move the slider to set the volume level.
>* Audio latency limiting is used to prevent the build up of latency in the audio stream
>over a period of time. Check the checkbox to enable audio latency limiting, or if that 
>causes any instability in the audio, uncheck it.
>
> Audio latency can build up because of network delay of audio packets. As the
> audio packets have a finite duration, delayed packets can cause a queue
> build up which will cause greater audio latency. The latency limiting works by calculating a suitable limit for the queue
> length above which the queue will be cleared down to just the latest audio packet. This
> process will result in the loss of a short part of the audio, as well as minimising
> the audio latency.
>
> If two-way audio is enabled, a <img src="README.images/microphone-off-svgrepo-com.svg" width="20"  style="position: relative; top: 5px"></img>
> button and a device selector will also be below the video. Select the required audio input
> device and click the <img src="README.images/microphone-off-svgrepo-com.svg" width="20"  style="position: relative; top: 5px"></img> button to
> speak. While audio output is active, the button changes to <img src="README.images/microphone-svgrepo-com.svg" width="20"  style="position: relative; top: 5px"></img>,
> click it again to turn audio output off.
>
> You can zoom in on the video by using the mouse wheel on a PC, or pinch zoom on a mobile. Mouse down and drag will pan the zoomed video while
> touch and move does the same on mobile. This is distinct from PTZ operations which can be done on suitable cameras.

##### Multi Camera View
The last option on the Select Camera menu is Multi Camera View. This shows one stream
from each camera in the configuration. The default stream shown
for a camera will be the one selected as Default On Multi Display.
The camera streams can be switched by clicking the
<img src="README.images/settings-svgrepo-com.svg" width="20"  style="position: relative; top: 5px"></img>
button at the top left of the page and changing the selection on the displayed pop-up form.
The number of display columns can also be selected on this form.
###### Number of columns
The Multi Camera View shows the cameras in a grid view which fills the width of the
viewport. The number of columns is selectable from one to four using radio buttons at the top 
of the pop-up form. Note that the number of displayed columns are reduced if the 
viewport width is too narrow, so if you have four columns selected, it will
actually show four, then three, then two, then one as you reduce the browser width. 
> Each video on multi-camera that has audio will have a speaker button below it, 
> which can be clicked to show the volume control and mute button.
> 
>Any cameras with two-way audio enabled will also have the <img src="README.images/microphone-off-svgrepo-com.svg" width="20"  style="position: relative; top: 5px"></img> button and device selector.
>
> Mouse wheel zoom and mouse down drag pan functions, and their mobile counterparts can be done on each of the videos.
#### Select Recording
This menu allows selection of recordings made on camera streams.
The names
are listed in the form <i>Camera Name(Stream Description)</i>.
On selection, the latest recording on that stream will be shown.
Earlier recordings can be selected from the date control and Motion
Events selector in the top left of the page. A warning box will appear if there are no recordings for the selected stream.

#### Camera Settings
* **Quick Camera Setup**

  <i>Quick Camera Setup is available only for SV3C and ZXTech cameras (as set in the
  configuration for Camera Type)</i>

  This provides a convenient means of setting the night lighting mode, and Camera Name.
  The camera can also be rebooted if required.
* **Camera Admin**

  Provides access to a cameras web admin page through an http proxy on the NVR. SV3C
  and ZXTech camera credentials are provided by the NVR if they
  were set up in the camera configuration page.
  Any other camera types will need their credentials entered after the camera is selected. Access is made through
  in http connection on port 8446 on the NVR. As it is insecure, it is only available within the LAN, but
  can be accessed securely on the open internet using a VPN.

  Note that for this function to be accessible outside the LAN, a VPN server must be installed (on the NVR or other suitable device on the LAN)
  and a VPN client on the client device outside the LAN.
  For a quick and easy way to set up a VPN, see https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn.

* **Ad Hoc Device Admin**

  This is the same functionality as Camera Admin above, but for devices whose details are entered as Ad Hoc Devices
 (see under the General menu). These devices could be smart switches such as those made by Shelley,
 No built-in authentication is supported for these devices, so any which
 require credentials will need those entered on access to the device.

* **Use Browser Caching**
  
   Applies to Camera Admin and Ad Hoc Device Admin above. The various devices are accessed through a single URL which
   can, in some cases, cause cached information to be used on web admin pages for a device other than the original one.
   For this reason it is best for this option to be off (checkbox unchecked), though the option is provided so that caching
   can be used if desired.


#### General
* **Configure Camera Setup**

  Set up the NVR for your set of cameras (which must be on the same LAN as the NVR).

  This is described in more detail under the section "Set Up Cameras" above.
* **Log Off**

  Log off from the NVR, a dialogue box allows confirmation or cancelling this operation.
* **Ad Hoc Hosting**

  From here you can set up the list of ad hoc devices whose web admin pages you want to 
  access through the NVR's Ad Hoc Device Admin menu. This option presents a form
  with an editable table with which you can add/edit and remove ad hoc device entries.
  The devices must present an HTTP web interface at the IP address and port entered here.
  When the form data is correct, you can save it with the
  <img src="README.images/floppy-svgrepo-com.svg" width="20"  style="position: relative; top: 5px"></img>
  button.
  <img alt="Ad Hoc Hosting" src="README.images/ad-hoc-hosting.png"></img>

* **Change Password**

  User must first enter the current password, then enter and confirm a new one.
* **Change Account Email**

  The email address is where password reset links will be sent when requesting from the login page. It is also where warning messages are sent if the public IP address has changed (for use with external access via port forwarding).

  User must first enter the password, then enter and confirm the new email address.
* **Set Up Guest Account**

  The guest account allows viewing the live streams and recordings, but does not allow any sort of admin operation which could alter the configuration.

  Enter and confirm a password for the guest account. This password
  is used with the username "guest" to log in. The checkbox allows the guest account to be enabled and disabled, while the password remains unaltered.

* **Save current IP**

  Save the current public IP that the NVR appears at (with port forwarding set up).

  If the public IP subsequently changes from this, a warning email will be sent to the registered
  email address, giving the new public IP address.

  This function is only used after setting up a new NVR or after the public IP has changed.
* **Get Active Local IP Addresses**

  Get the LAN addresses of the NVR. There are IP addresses for the Wi-Fi and Ethernet interfaces.
* **Wifi Admin**
    * **Local Wifi Details**

      Lists the Wi-Fi access points in the area along with msgQueue strength and other information.
    * **Wifi Settings**

      Setup or enable/disable the NVR Wi-Fi connection.

      To use this the NVR must have an Ethernet connection, and the browser must be connected to the NVR through the Ethernet IP address.
* **Set CloudProxy Status**

**Note, An experimental Cloud Service has been developed (see <a href="https://github.com/richard-austin/cloud-server">here</a>). This works in conjunction with <a href="https://github.com/richard-austin/activemq-for-cloud-service">ActiveMQ</a>**
For information on accessing the NVR through the Cloud Service, see README_CLOUD.md
* **Admin Functions**

  The initial setup functions used to set credentials for a direct access account.
  This can be accessed on the LAN without authentication at http://nvr_lan_ip_addr:8080/cua/.

  Click on the <img src="README.images/hamburger-2-svgrepo-com.svg" width="20"  style="position: relative; top: 5px"></img> icon at the top left for the menu optionsÂ·
    * **Create or Update User Account**

      When accessed via the General -> Admin Functions menu, a user account will already exist.
      In this case you can use this to modify the username and/or password and/or email address for the account.
      In any case, all those fields must be entered before clicking Update Account.
    * **Set Up SMTP Client**

      The SMTP Client must be set up for the NVR to send emails (reset password and changed public IP notification).

      Use this if you need to set up or change the settings for the NVR's SMTP client.
      All fields must be entered before clicking Confirm. Any existing values will be
      shown in their fields.
